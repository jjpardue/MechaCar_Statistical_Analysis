1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length and ground clearance variables provided non-random degrees of variance compared to the MPG values.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value for this set is smaller than the assumed significance (p-value: 5.35e-11) which tells us that there is evidence to reject a null hypothosis, as well, inidicates that slope would not be zero. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model encompasses approximately 71% of MPG predictions which tells us that it is a good model for prototyping.
